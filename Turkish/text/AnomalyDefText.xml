        <Label>Anomaly_FinishProjectArtifact_Dec</Label>
        <String>A scan of this Precursor artifact doesn't reveal anything unusual, but when that scan is backed up to the nearest colonial database, strange things start happening. The physical structure of the artifact itself is a form of self-executing code, which seizes control of the colonial computer, and soon after the manufacturing sector. Thousands of tiny worker bots are produced which almost immediately complete the project currently in progress on the world. They then immediately shut down.</String>

    <StringTable>
        <Label>Anomaly_FinishTechArtifact_Dec</Label>
        <String>This is a sentient [HS=HS_ArtifactResearchCharge]Precursor Archive[/HS]. When our survey team member attempts to interface with it he claims to have boundless knowledge and shows all the signs of a remarkable and sudden increase in intelligence. Over the next several minutes, he details astounding technological breakthroughs until his head explodes.</String>

        <String>This capsule of [HS=HS_ArtifactPlanetClass]Chimeric Biomass[/HS] was fired into space in the hopes it would find a new world to revitalize. While it never found its original target, we can now repurpose it to improve the ecosystem of any world we choose.</String>

        <String>A strange device here has trapped a creature from another dimension. We can collect the [HS=HS_ArtifactCagedMonster]Dimensional Snare[/HS] and release the creature in an area of our choosing. Hard to say what the effects of that will be. Don't bet a lot of money on the creature being grateful to us, however.</String>

        <Label>Anomaly_GetActivatedNanites_Dec</Label>
        <String>We've discovered a container filled with specialized Nanites capable of examining the structure of whatever material they are exposed to, determining its original design via an encyclopedic knowledge of engineering principles and semantic cues, and then rebuilding it back to like-new condition. The end result is we can use these [HS=HS_ArtifactFleetRepair]Mnemonic Nanites[/HS] to instantly repair any of our fleets.</String>

        <String>We've discovered a high energy fuel source. Although it won't last long, it is enough to get a substantial increase in output from any ship's engine. We can use this [HS=HS_ArtifactFleetResetMoves]Boost Coil[/HS] to reset the moves of any of our fleets.</String>

        <String>We've discovered a massive mine, with the markings of Precursor technology. We're fortunate it didn't trigger by our approach, though perhaps it was smart enough to detect we weren't a threat. We should be able to collect it and adapt its key component, a [HS=HS_ArtifactFleetDamage]Betatron Collider[/HS], into a device that can inflict heavy damage on an enemy fleet.</String>

        <String>This cargo module is a self contained habitat, complete with a synthetic workforce, idle for now but otherwise in perfect condition. We can use this [HS=HS_ArtifactPlanetPopulation]Bernal Sphere[/HS] to add a citizen to any of our worlds.</String>

        <String>This artifact was intended as part of a larger terraforming project that would convert a dead world into a paradise. Unfortunately only the first stage is working, a [HS=HS_ArtifactPlanetPollution]Climate Purifier[/HS] that will remove the most caustic elements from the planet's atmosphere.</String>

        <String>The capsule contains military equipment, which is not normally found in civilian containers such as this. It seems likely it was dropped by smugglers before an inspection. Their loss is our gain, but we'll have to decide how to best make use of it.</String>

        <String>The alien computational systems found in this capsule are so advanced that our survey team lack the vocabulary to describe all but their most rudimentary functions. But even those low-level capabilities would be enough to advance our technological studies by leaps and bounds.</String>

        <String>We've discovered a beacon sending a distress call for an emergency that happened millennia ago. Grave threat, galaxy's only hope, please, anyone, something something. Though we are perhaps a little late to respond to the emergency itself, the broadcast equipment in the beacon can certainly be put to use.</String>

        <Label>Anomaly_LostScoutAnomoly_Dec</Label>
        <String>A small vessel drifts in deep space, all systems dead. Upon examination it appears to be an old scout from some long forgotten war. Its capabilities do not strain even the moderate intellects crewing our survey ship, and with a little work they believe it could be restored to service.</String>

        <Label>Anomaly_LostSurveyAnomoly_Dec</Label>
        <String>This survey ship is similar to Terran vessels, but our crew can't find an exact match anywhere in the database. The exterior shows signs of wormhole passage, but is otherwise in good shape. The interior however, needs substantial cleanup to deal with a mysterious green goo. There's no sign of the occupants, unless they're the green goo, which.... they might be actually. Still. Free ship.</String>

        <String>Our survey crew finds a scorched but salvageable vessel amid the wreckage of a forgotten skirmish that appears to have occurred during the Dread Lord war. The bodies of the crew are found within, apparently executed. By their opponents, or perhaps their peers, it's hard to say - the Dread Lords cruelty was infamous. In any event, there are few obstacles preventing our crew from repairing the ship and pressing it into service.</String>

        <String>We've discovered an enormous Drengin battlecruiser floating in deep space, its hull perforated by thousands of small kinetic impacts. It is wholly unsalvageable. A Terran gunboat drifting nearby, however, is still in working order. The pilot's mummified remains still have their hands on the cannon controls, a smile frozen forever on their face.</String>

        <String>Here lie the remains of a starbase, destroyed beyond any hope of salvage. Nearby however lies an abandoned constructor, never given a chance to fulfill its function. Minimal repairs will be needed to get it working again, to the point it can create a starbase of our own.</String>

        <String>Your survey ship is caught in an unknown field and sucked through a hole in space itself.
