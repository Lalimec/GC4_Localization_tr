        <String>Even in 2307, the Yor Singularity remains a powerful force in the Galaxy. Long have they strived to bring others into their collective consciousness -the Totality. Though their programming compels them to continue to expand and convert organic to synthetic, they are far from alone among the stars.[BR][BR]The Singularity must make several critical decisions that will determine their efforts for decades. Who among the other Civilizations do they forge alliances with, and who do they destroy? Will their bitter conflict with their creators, the Iconian Refuge, ever end?</String>

        <String>The Yor are artificial beings, originally servants of an ancient species known as the Iconians. Granted sentience by the Dread Lords, the Yor turned against their Iconian creators, apparently wiping them from the face of the galaxy. Whether due to some hidden command of the Dread Lords, or simply from applying the cold rules of logic, the Yor have since become viciously xenophobic, and now despise all biological lifeforms. Capable of long-term planning and a surprising degree of cunning, the Yor often speak and negotiate with organic beings. Those beings should understand that this is nothing but a short-term ploy, and that their new friends will never rest until they, and all other organic life, are destroyed.</String>

        <String>The Corporate Sector is the apex corporate entity of an ultra-capitalistic society, the only organization capable of entering into contracts on behalf of the entire Iridium people. The Iridium culture is based on a firm, even fanatical belief in the power of free markets. Although no strangers to weaponry, all research is first considered through the lens of mutual cooperation; the destructive cost of warfare is often too great for Iridiums to seriously consider. It remains to be seen how well this philosophy will fare when introduced to more close-minded races.</String>

[BR][BR]In the annals of the Drengin Empire, the Korath have etched a name for themselves as the epitome of brutality - the quintessential shock troops. Their presence in battle, marked by unprecedented ferocity and a ruthless penchant for destruction, has long been a harbinger of dread. The Korath harbor a zealous belief in the absolute supremacy of the Drengin, viewing all other forms of life as not only inferior but as existential blights unworthy of existence. This extremist ideology sets them apart, even from the Drengin Empire, known for subjugating rather than annihilating perceived inferiors. Such radical divergence in philosophy eventually led to the Korath's estrangement from the Empire. Further distinguishing themselves, the Korath underwent a sinister transformation after their encounters with the enigmatic Dread Lords, emerging as beings who not only believed themselves to be the pinnacle of Drengin evolution but also as harbingers of annihilation for all other species, including their former Drengin brethren.</String>
