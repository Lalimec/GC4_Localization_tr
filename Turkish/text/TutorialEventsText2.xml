        <String>In 2178, the humans of a United Earth developed Hyperdrive Propulsion systems, discovering faster-than-light travel.[BR][BR]Humanity had already established interstellar contact with two civilizations: The Korx and the Arcean Empire. Some scientists, eager to share their discoveries, transmit the specifications for the new drive systems to the Arceans and the Korx. Both groups go silent immediately after receiving the specifications for this new technology. Earth is left alone in the universe once again.[BR][BR]You are Commander DL Bradley, leader of the newly formed Terran Alliance. This group has been created to oversee the manned exploration of space and the colonization of new planets. Humanity's new Hyperdrive Propulsion makes such grand ambitions possible.[BR][BR]Unfortunately, you must contend with a new threat: Pirates. A group of terrorists have acquired the Hyperdrive plans. They threaten all colonization efforts as long as they keep a foothold in nearby star systems. At some point, we will need to find and destroy their base.[BR][BR]Your primary mission is to colonize at least 8 worlds with at least one large enough to warrant a governor and establish leaders to support the effort.</String>
